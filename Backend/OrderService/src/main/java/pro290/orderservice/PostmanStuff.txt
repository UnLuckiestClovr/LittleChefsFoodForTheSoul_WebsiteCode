The list of numbers at the end is a dummy UUID for testing purposes.
You must include a body which is a list of OrderItem, here is an example
[
    {
        "itemId": "Extra 1"
    },
    {
        "itemId": "Extra 2"
    }
]
I believe there is still problems with connecting things as the Order_oid
and the recipe_order_id are still null.
